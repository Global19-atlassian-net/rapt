### TIGRFAMs

The original TIGRFAMs database was a research project of the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) . TIGRFAMs, short for The Institute for Genomic Research's database of protein families, is a collection of manually curated protein families focusing primarily on prokaryotic sequences. It consists of hidden Markov models (HMMs), multiple sequence alignments, Gene Ontology (GO) terminology, Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, gene symbols, protein family names, descriptive text, cross-references to related models in TIGRFAMs and other databases, and pointers to the literature. The work has been described in the articles listed in the References section above and use of the TIGRFAMs database must grant proper attribution by citing those four articles.
